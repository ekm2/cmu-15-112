longestDigitRun(n)
Write the function longestDigitRun(n) that takes a possibly-negative int value n and returns the digit that has the longest consecutive run, or the smallest such digit if there is a tie. So, longestDigitRun(117773732) returns 7 (because there is a run of 3 consecutive 7's), as does longestDigitRun(-677886).


Solution:

def longestDigitRun(n):
   """Takes a possibly-negative int value n.
   Returns the digit which has the longest consecutive run, or the smallest  such digit if there is a tie"""
   n=abs(n)
   for i in range(n):
     count=0
     newCount=0
     while i==i+1:
       newCount +=1 
     if newCount>=count:
       return i 
   return i
